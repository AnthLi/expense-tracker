# expense-tracker (WIP)

A simple expense tracking web app built using [Go](https://golang.org/) for the
back-end, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for the front-end and
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) for the database. This is
simply a side project of mine that I wanted to develop for personal use, but
anyone can use it.

### Usage
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/anthli/expense-tracker
$ cd path/to/directory
$ go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
$ go get gopkg.in/pg.v4
$ go get github.com/icza/session
$ bower install
$ go run app.go
```
